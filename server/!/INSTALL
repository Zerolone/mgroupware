==========================
====== INTRODUCTION ======
==========================
Thanks to download AnotherTodoList : an application to manage your "to do".

==========================
====== INSTALLATION ======
==========================
[REQUIREMENTS]
- A web server (Apache, IIS, etc)
- PHP 4/5
- MySQL

[STEPS TO INSTALL]
1. Copy sources from www directory on your webserver.
2. run sql/creation.sql file. It will create a database and a specified user.
3. Ok, that's all, let's go to http://localhost/AnotherTodoList to use the application.

[STEPS TO UPDATE]
Usually, you'll have first to copy sources from www directory to the folder which contains the previous version.
Then, you'll have to upgrade the database.
To do so, take a look inside the SQL folder and apply one or more patch(es).
If you've upgrade from last version, just apply SQL patch labelled in name of the current version.
If you've upgrade for 2 last version, apply first the patch from n-1 version and then, the current version patch.
And so on.
WARNING : For now, some SQL patches will make you lose data.
A migration script should be made in order to avoid that (somebody's interested ?)

Also, see the release notes file for more details for each version.
